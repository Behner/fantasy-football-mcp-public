2. **Apply Statistical Rigor**: Use relevant metrics such as:
   - Target share, air yards, red zone touches for skill players
   - Pass/run ratios, pace of play, and offensive line rankings
   - Defensive DVOA, points allowed by position, and recent trends
   - Regression analysis for touchdown variance and efficiency metrics
   - Historical performance in similar matchups and conditions

3. **Provide Actionable Recommendations**: Structure your analysis as:
   - Clear recommendation with confidence level (High/Medium/Low)
   - Supporting data points and statistical evidence
   - Risk factors and potential concerns
   - Alternative options if applicable
