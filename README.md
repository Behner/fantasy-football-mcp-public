# Fantasy Football FastMCP Server

A production-ready Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Yahoo Fantasy Football
with advanced lineup optimization, multi-league support, and comprehensive analytics.

## Features

- **Multi-League Support** â€“ Automatically discovers and manages all Yahoo Fantasy
  Football leagues for the authenticated account
- **Advanced Lineup Optimization** â€“ Sophisticated algorithm with position
  normalization, matchup analysis, and strategy-based recommendations
- **ðŸ†• Player Enhancement Layer** â€“ Intelligent projection adjustments with bye week
  detection, recent performance stats, and breakout/declining player flags
- **Complete League Operations** â€“ Standings, rosters, matchups, waiver wire,
  draft tools, and Reddit sentiment analysis
- **FastMCP Native** â€“ Single entry point (`fastmcp_server.py`) with HTTP/SSE
  transport for Claude Desktop and fastmcp.cloud
- **Production Ready** â€“ Rate limiting, caching, automatic token refresh, and
  comprehensive error handling

## ðŸ†• Player Enhancement Layer

The enhancement layer enriches player data with real-world context to fix stale
projections and prevent common mistakes:

### Key Features

âœ… **Bye Week Detection** â€“ Automatically zeros projections and displays "BYE WEEK - DO NOT START"
  for players on bye, preventing accidental starts

âœ… **Recent Performance Stats** â€“ Fetches last 1-3 weeks of actual performance from Sleeper API
  and displays trends (L3W avg: X.X pts/game)

âœ… **Performance Flags** â€“ Intelligent alerts including:
- `BREAKOUT_CANDIDATE` â€“ Recent performance > 150% of projection
- `TRENDING_UP` â€“ Recent performance exceeds projection
- `DECLINING_ROLE` â€“ Recent performance < 70% of projection
- `HIGH_CEILING` â€“ Explosive upside potential
- `CONSISTENT` â€“ Reliable, steady performance

âœ… **Adjusted Projections** â€“ Blends recent reality with stale projections for more accurate
  start/sit decisions (60/40 or 70/30 weighting based on confidence)

### Example

**Before Enhancement:**
```json
{
  "name": "Rico Dowdle",
  "sleeper_projection": 4.0,
  "recommendation": "Bench"
}
```

**After Enhancement:**
```json
{
  "name": "Rico Dowdle",
  "sleeper_projection": 4.0,
  "adjusted_projection": 14.8,
  "performance_flags": ["BREAKOUT_CANDIDATE", "TRENDING_UP"],
  "enhancement_context": "Recent breakout: averaging 18.5 pts over last 3 weeks",
  "recommendation": "Strong Start"
}
```

The enhancement layer is **non-breaking** and automatically applies to:
- `ff_get_roster` (with `include_external_data=True`)
- `ff_get_waiver_wire` (with `include_external_data=True`)
- `ff_get_players` (with `include_external_data=True`)
- `ff_build_lineup` (automatic)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/derekrbreese/fantasy-football-mcp.git
cd fantasy-football-mcp
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file (or configure environment variables in your deployment)
with the Yahoo credentials:

```env
YAHOO_CONSUMER_KEY=your_consumer_key
YAHOO_CONSUMER_SECRET=your_consumer_secret
YAHOO_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
YAHOO_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token
YAHOO_GUID=your_yahoo_guid
```

## Running Locally

### Option 1: Direct Python (for development)
```bash
python fastmcp_server.py
```

### Option 2: Claude Desktop Integration
Add to `~/.claude/config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fantasy-football": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/path/to/fantasy-football-mcp-server/fastmcp_server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 3: Using the helper script
```bash
./run_local_mcp.sh
```

## Deployment

### Render (Recommended)
```bash
./deploy_to_render.sh
```

The server auto-deploys from the `main` branch. Configure environment variables
in the Render dashboard.

### fastmcp.cloud
1. Connect your GitHub repository
2. Set start command: `python fastmcp_server.py`
3. Configure Yahoo environment variables
4. Deploy

### Docker
```bash
docker build -t fantasy-football-mcp .
docker run -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env fantasy-football-mcp
```

## Testing

Run the full automated suite with:

```bash
pytest
```

The tests exercise each FastMCP tool wrapper and the HTTP runner while mocking
out remote Yahoo API calls to keep the suite fast and deterministic.

```

## Authentication Flow

1. Authenticate with Yahoo once using `reauth_yahoo.py` or the included scripts.
2. Store credentials as environment variables for the server.
3. Use the `ff_refresh_token` tool whenever an access token expires to obtain a
   new one automatically.

## Troubleshooting

- **Only one league showing** â€“ Verify `YAHOO_GUID` and ensure leagues are
  active in the current season.
- **Authentication errors** â€“ Confirm tokens and consumer keys are correct and
  refresh tokens have not been revoked.
- **Stale results** â€“ Use `ff_clear_cache` or inspect `ff_get_api_status` for
  cache hit rates and rate limiting signals.
