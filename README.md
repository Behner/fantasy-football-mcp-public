## Authentication Flow

1. Initial setup requires OAuth2 authentication with Yahoo
2. Access tokens are stored and automatically refreshed
3. GUID identifies your account across all leagues
4. Team detection uses both GUID and login status

## Development

### Running Tests
```bash
pytest tests/
```

### Testing the Server
```bash
python test_multi_league_server.py
```

## Security Notes

- Never commit `.env` files or API credentials
- Keep your Yahoo tokens secure
- Store tokens securely and never expose them
- Regularly rotate access tokens if needed

## Troubleshooting

### Only one league showing
- Ensure YAHOO_GUID is set in `.env`
- Verify all leagues are active for current season
- Check team ownership detection is working

### Authentication errors
- Verify Yahoo app settings match redirect URI
- Ensure tokens are current and valid
- Check Consumer Key/Secret are correct
